export function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div className='p-4'>
      <div>
        <h1 className='text-2xl text-primary font-bold'>Dashboard</h1>
        <h3 className='text-[16px] text-secondary font-semibold mt-2 mb-4'>
          Currently we are not generating any stats (as I am a solo developer
          working on it), but pretty soon we will have something (PROBABLY)
        </h3>
        <p className='text-secondary font-medium text-[14px]'>
          But in case you want to feel like looking at dashboard here are some
          pretty useless charts, show unemployment chart, or number of people
          know react chart
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
